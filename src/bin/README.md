# Binaries: `dls` and `dtree`

This directory contains the two companion binaries for **dirdocs**:

- **`dls`** — A Nushell-style `ls` replacement with descriptions.
- **`dtree`** — A tree-style directory viewer with descriptions.

Both tools use the `.dirdocs.nu` file (generated by the main `dirdocs` binary) to enrich output with **file descriptions**, **joy ratings**, and **personality emojis**.

---

## `dls`

`dls` is a modernized `ls` command that:

- Displays files in a table format similar to Nushell’s built-in `ls`.
- Pulls in **descriptions** from `.dirdocs.nu` to annotate each file.
- Supports additional **fun** columns for **personality emojis** and **joy ratings**.
- Honors `.gitignore` and hidden file rules.
- Uses `LS_COLORS` and Nushell’s color theme for output styling.

**Example:**

```bash
λ : dls src
#   name         type   size   modified       description
0   bin          dir    —      2 days ago    Executable binaries for dirdocs
1   cache.rs     file   4 KB   1 day ago     Processes directory cache files for documentation indexing
2   content.rs   file   8 KB   5 days ago    Analyzes files for text content, metadata, and integrity
```

With `--fun`:

```bash
λ : dls src --fun
#   name         type   size   modified       description                          personality   joy
0   cache.rs     file   4 KB   1 day ago     Processes directory cache files...    🐢            6
1   content.rs   file   8 KB   5 days ago    Analyzes files for text content...    🦊            8
```

## `dtree`

`dtree` is a recursive tree viewer that:

- Prints the directory tree structure with **descriptions** inline.
- Honors `.gitignore` and hidden file rules.
- Supports two styles of tree connectors:
  - **Emoji tree** (default): 🪾 for branches, 🍃 for leaves.
  - **Classic ASCII tree** with `--boring`: `├──`, `└──`, `│   `, etc.
- Colors **all connectors and names** according to file or directory type.

**Example (emoji mode):**

```bash
λ : dtree src
src
🪾 bin
🪾  🍃 dls.rs — Renders directory contents with custom formatting and metadata
🪾  🍃 dtree.rs — Tree-style view with descriptions
🍃 cache.rs — Processes directory cache files for documentation indexing
🍃 content.rs — Analyzes files for text content, file metadata, and data integrity
```

**Example (boring/classic mode):**

```bash
λ : dtree src --boring
src
├── bin
│   ├── dls.rs — Renders directory contents with custom formatting and metadata
│   └── dtree.rs — Tree-style view with descriptions
├── cache.rs — Processes directory cache files for documentation indexing
├── content.rs — Analyzes files for text content, file metadata, and data integrity
```

## Common Behavior

- Both commands respect `.gitignore`, global gitignore, and hidden files unless overridden.
- Both colorize output using `LS_COLORS` and Nushell theme integration.
- Both pull enriched metadata (descriptions, emojis, joy ratings) from `.dirdocs.nu`.
